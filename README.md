# VespeRover
The beginnings of a fully-autonomous rover.

This project is laying the foundation for `vesper-vacuumer`, and is intended to be the implementation of an Arduino-powered
rover, capable of autonomy.

The board used is an Elegoo Mega 2560.

There is much work to be done, including detailed pictures, schematics, and a lot more code to write.
To get the full functionality intended, it's likely that a Neural-Network of some sort will be utilized,
but the primary goal as of now is getting comfortable w/how to actually control the rover.
